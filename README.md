### Purpose

This research paper aims to quantify the historically qualitative subject of women’s fashion trends in the United States. It delves into the intricate relationship between American history, culture, and fashion, and explores how fashion not only influences its surroundings, but also how it can be impacted by its environment. While acknowledging the impact of factors such as the economy and socio-political climate on fashion trends, there is a noticeable gap in empirical data linking such influences to fashion evolution. Thus, this study aims to address this knowledge gap by analyzing a dataset of tagged images scraped from Vogue Runway’s website. Anticipated findings include correlations between darker colors and looser silhouettes with times of economic uncertainty, typically stemming from major national events. Through this analysis, the paper aims to provide deeper quantitative insights into the interplay between women’s fashion trends and significant American milestones.

### Data

Description: The dataset is comprised of "tags" based on images from Vogue Runway's website. The images were collected using a web scraping app from GitHub called "Vogue Runway Scraper".

Sources: Data compiled from public domain sources.

### Findings

Overall, this analysis shows that there are definitely underlying factors that contribute to changes in fashion trends. This project helped to convey how there are aspects of women’s fashion that come and go with time, but there are also garments that appear to transcend the different “fads” fashion goes through (Miller et. al. 1993). Through creating a dataset and leveraging statistical methods for data analysis, this research accomplished its goal of quantifying the qualities of women’s fashion trends, although the findings were not all in alignment with the original research questions. Similar to what Sproles wrote in Analyzing Fashion Life Cycles, fashion trends will evolve in “long” and “short” cycles; this analysis examined fashion in the more short term, and it would be worthwhile to examine a broader range of years to get a more holistic sense of the long term fashion life cycles, and how color, fit, and length correlate with other times in American history. Going forward, this project could also benefit from being expanded upon– broadening not only the time periods measured– but also the independent variables, the sources of the images, or repeating the analysis on men’s fashion.
