### Purpose

This investigation in data analytics aims to explore the topic of fashion trends and major historical milestones in the United States; its goal is to answer the question of whether a correlation exists between certain fashion trends and major national events, such as the Roaring 20’s, the Great Depression, the Civil Rights movement, or even the COVID-19 pandemic. My project would utilize datasets including sales data of different clothing pieces and/or brands as well as image analysis of various colors and silhouettes around the time periods of certain major events. For example, “although stylish, Black Panthers also wore sunglasses as part of their uniform to conceal their identities…FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover wanted to end the Black Panther Party’s existence and declared them ‘the greatest threat to internal security of the country’” (Taylor, 2022). I believe this research is important, because it could shed light on how major historical events can impact American culture in ways that have previously gone unnoticed. It could also demonstrate how clothing may have the potential to make predictions: if it were discovered that certain trends repeat themselves in accordance with certain events (ex: the color blue becomes popular every time there is economic instability), this data could continue to be analyzed, possibly picking up on a political or economic climate before it fully manifests.
